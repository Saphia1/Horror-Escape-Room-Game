The room is locked but you hear footprints outside.
By completing tasks and puzzles find a way out before its too late. Do not get caught more than three times!
Interact with the map and objects to find clues and secrets.
Feel free to run but remember! As you sprint your energy level decreases and needs to regenerate before you can run again!
Good luck!
